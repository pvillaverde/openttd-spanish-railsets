<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Customizes OpenTTD railway sets with the spanish railways: FEVE (Narrow Gauge), AVE (High Speed) and improvements on the main lines based on U&ReRMM2 railway sets.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Requirements

- OpenTTD (<http://www.openttd.org>).

### Installation

- Download it through the integrated content manager in the game or through [BaNaNaS](http://bananas.openttd.org)
- You may also [manual install it](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/NewGRF#manual-install), download or compile the `.grf` and put it on the OpenTTD `newgrf` directory.

### How to Compile it (from Linux)

- [Install NML with its requirements](http://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/NML:Getting_started)
- Download last version from this repository <https://github.com/pvillaverde/openttd-spanish-railsets>
- In order to compile the NewGRF you only need to execute this command:
  -  `nmlc -c --grf galician-town-name.grf galician-town-names.nml`
